### Car Policy Request - Initial.bpmn

The main process, **Car Policy Request**, you will use to populate some data.

### Create Multiple Policy Requests.bpmn

This process will call the **Car Policy Request** process several times thanks to the out of the box BPMN functionalities: [Call Activities](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/call-activities/) and [Multi instantiation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/multi-instance/).
